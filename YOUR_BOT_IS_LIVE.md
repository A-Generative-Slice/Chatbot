3. ✅ Ensure you joined the sandbox first
4. ✅ Check ngrok inspector for incoming requests
5. ✅ Look at server terminal for errors

### Ngrok URL changed?
- Ngrok free tier gives new URL on each restart
- Update webhook URL in Twilio when ngrok restarts
- Or upgrade to ngrok paid for static URL

### Server not responding?
```powershell
# Check server health
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3000/health

# Restart server if needed
npm run start:debug
```
