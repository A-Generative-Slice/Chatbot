# Rose Chemicals — WhatsApp Support Bot

This repository contains a customer-facing WhatsApp bot that helps customers of Rose Chemicals quickly find products, check prices, and get assistance in their preferred language.

Key user-facing capabilities:
- Browse a catalog of cleaning products
- Get fast product recommendations and pricing
- Support in multiple Indian languages (user can select language interactively)
- Simple conversational flow: greet, choose language, ask for product

How customers use it:
1. Send "Hi" to the WhatsApp business number.
2. The bot prompts for language selection.
3. Ask for a product or a category (e.g., "soap", "floor cleaner").
4. The bot replies with options and prices.

If you are maintaining this project, see the source files for implementation details. Sensitive credentials and deployment configuration are intentionally excluded from this public README.

For deployment, the service needs a running server with the appropriate environment variables configured. If you want, I can help deploy this to a free hosting provider and update the README with non-sensitive deployment steps.
